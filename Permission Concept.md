There are a few choices in permissions I have

1) All Action permissions are allowed unless prevented
2) All Action permissions do not exist unless otherwise specified

What is definitely true is that
- each Action can only be done by a player
- Cards can enable generic actions that use other cards as costs
  - That player "own"s the action
- Cards can have their own actions that a player can use
  - That card "own"s the action
- Piles have their own actions that a player can use
  - That pile "owns"s the action

Players can always
1) Leave

Piles can always
1. Be Counted
2. Be Viewed
3. Be Reordered
  - individual/group card choice-alogirthm
  - card/group goes to top + offset-algortithm
  - card/group goes to bottom + offset-algorithm
  - 2 cards/groups exchange places
3. Be Broken into piles
  - group choice-algorithm
4. Be combined with other piles
  - Other piles must have same permissions and actions
  - Group iterator-algorithm
5. Have a individual/group moved to a pre-existing Pile
