Player's Choices can come from a few places

All players Are initially 'uninvolved'

When a player is going to make a decision, the player is considered 'deciding'
When a player is resolving a decision, the player is considered 'active'

1) Unchallenged
  - The Game Naturally Gives each player a chance to make a choice
  - This is important to allow each player the opportunity to win
  - If the game doesn't, it is not a game
2) Reaction
  - The Game may give each player a chance to 'react' to another's choice
  - The order of reaction acceptance is game dependent (i.e. The first to react goes first or turn order)
  - Each Player must choose whether or not they wish to react
    - We consider all players that can react as 'deciding', 'queued', 'ignoring' or 'active'
    - if nobody reacts - Finish Resolution of the choice
    - if yes
      - We now consider that player the 'active' player that can do any action they are able to
      - We consider player's choice was enabled by the others choice
      - We also considered the player giving the opportunity to have their resolution 'influenced'
3) Offer
  - The Game may give each or all players a choice they may or may not take
  - Who (whether single or multiple) recieves the offer is game dependent
  - The order of Offer resolution is game dependent (i.e. The first to react goes first or turn order)
  - Each Player must choose one of the options in the Offer
    - We consider all players that must make a choice as 'deciding', 'queued', 'ignoring' or 'finished'
    - an Option may or may not be to ignore the offer
    -
      - We now consider that player the 'deciding' player that can do any action they are able to
      - We consider player's choice was enabled by the others choice

Decision can result in
1) Modifications to the Game state
  - During this time that last player 'deciding' will be considered 'active'
2) if the decision was a reaction, resolve what allowed the reaction
3) if the decision was an Offer Acceptance, resolve what created the Offer
